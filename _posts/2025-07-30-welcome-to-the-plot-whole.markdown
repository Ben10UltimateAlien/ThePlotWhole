Welcome to The Plot Whole. Over the last few years I've been trying to get back into writting about things I'm passionate about, like anime, manga and games but there's always been this barrier. It started with the fact that starting this on my own required me to create website, and being the perfectionist I am, I wanted something really polished (and that means that when life got in the way it never happened), and from the get go I had massive ideas of what I wanted for the website, and they were (looking back, rather irrealistic). So here I am again, a second attempt, this time I'm trying to keep it simple.

My main objective for this project, at this point, is to have a place to dump my thoughts and ideas, and at the same time have something to send to people when they ask for my opinions and recomendations. Like a hub of what I've been watching and my thoughts.
