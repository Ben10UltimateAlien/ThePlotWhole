# Welcome to The Plot Whole
Over the last few years I've been trying to get back into writting about things I'm passionate about like anime, manga and games but there's always been this (mental) barrier. It started with the fact that starting this on my own required me to create a platform, be it a website or social media account. I'm not big on social media, so the way to go was a blog, but me being the perfectionist I am I wanted something really polished before I could feel comfortable putting it out there (and that meant that when life got in the way the polishing up never happened). From the get go I had massive ideas of what I wanted for the website and (looking back) they were rather irrealistic.

So here I am again, this time I'm trying to keep it really simple, to lower the energy barrier to just write.

My main objective for this project, is to have a place to dump my thoughts and ideas, and at the same time have something to send to people when they ask for my opinions and recomendations. Like a hub of what I've been watching and my thoughts.
