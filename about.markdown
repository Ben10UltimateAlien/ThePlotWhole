Welcome to The Plot Whole, where I ramble about whatever interests me at the moment. You can expect mainly anime rants (since that's what I'm usually watching), but I also dable in manga, video games, and TTRPGs on occasion.


I'm Inconum, and I've been watching and analysing anime for over ten years. I've written for a friend's blog for a while up to 2020, and have organized media analysis workshops. I am very interested in the anime industry in particular, but also in general storytelling rules and convetions (that I also use as tools when I slip on the shoes of Game Master for multiple TTRPGs). I am a life sciences PhD student, and study japanese in my spare time, so this is my creative writting side-gig (if you can call overthinking media a creative endeavour).

I am developing this project more for myself, to document what I'm watching and my less structured thoughts, but if any of this sounds interesting to you, come join the whole dive.
